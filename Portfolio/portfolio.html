                    <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 1.</h3>
                    <p class="text">This is the first project that I did in this "Webbutvecklings" course.
                        It was also the first time I tried coding in HTML and CSS. The assignment was to
                        create a simple webpage with both text and images. I also had to add different links,
                        I used absulute, relative and complete links as well as links inside the website.
                        the outcome was a webpage that looked like this:
                    </p>
                    <img class="projectpicture-one projectpicture" src="/Images/Uppgift1bild.png"
                        alt="Picture of prject 1.">
                </div>
                <div class="center flex">
                    <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 2.</h3>
                    <p class="text text2">This was the second project. This time I was familiar with basics
                        so this went a little smother. The assignment was to use "div" and flexbox to
                        being able to move text and pictures. And the outcome looked like this:</p>
                    <img class="projectpicture-two projectpicture" src="/Images/Uppgift2bild.png"
                        alt="Picture of project 2.">
                </div>
                <div class="center flex">
                    <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 3.</h3>
                    <p class="text text3">This was the third project. This assignment was to get familiarized
                        position. This went well and I also learned to use the css-properties sticky and fixed.
                        The outcome looked like this:</p>
                    <img class="projectpicture-three projectpicture" src="/Images/Uppgift3bild.png"
                        alt="Picture of project 3">
                </div>
                <div class="center flex">
                    <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 4.</h3>
                    <p class="text text4">This was the fourth project. This time i learned to inbed animations into
                    the css code. I also learned to add a youtube video on the webpage that plays if you click on it
                    and if you want, you can view it in fullscreen. The outcome looked like this:</p>
                    <img class="projectpicture-three projectpicture" src="/Images/Uppgift4bild.png"
                        alt="Picture of project 4">
                </div>
                <div class="center flex">
                    <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 5.</h3>
                    <p class="text text5">This was the fifth project. Display: grid was what I was learning about this time. 
                    I learned to change grid rows and grid columns aswell as the gaps inbetween. 
                    This how it ended up looking:
